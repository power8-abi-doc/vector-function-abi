Vector Function Application Binary Interface Specification for POWER8 Processor

<li><h2> Vector Function Overview </h2></li>

The vector (simd in OpenMP literature) function annotation applies to C/C++
functions. Either OpenMP pragma or GCC __attribute__ syntax can be used to
enable function vectorization.

Use of simd annotation on function declaration or definition allows the
compiler to create vector versions of a function from the scalar function
definition provided. The vector versions of functions are used, when
appropriate, in the optimization steps of compilation (e.g. automatic loop
vectorization)

This ABI defines the details of the caller-callee interface for vector
functions; including parameter passing to and returning values from vector
functions.

<li><h2> Vector Function ABI </h2></li>

The vector function ABI defines a set of rules that the caller and callee must
obey. These rules consist of:
<ul>
<li> Calling convention (how arguments are passed to the vector function and
how values are returned from the vector function)</li>
<li> Vector length< /li>
<li> Vector function masking </li>
<li> Mapping from existing data types to vector data types </li>
<li> Vector function name mangling </li>
</ul>

</ol>

<ol>
<li><h2> Calling Convention </h2></li>
All functions (including compiler-created vector functions) use the Function
Calling Sequence defined in OpenPOWER 64-bit ELF V2 ABI Specification for Power
Architecture.

<li><h2> Vector Length </h2></li>
Every vector variant of a function has a vector length (VLEN). If the
vectorlength clause is used, then VLEN is the value of the argument of that
clause. VLEN must be an integer power of 2.
If the vectorlength clause is not used, the notion of the function's
"characteristic data type" is used to compute the vector length. The
characteristic data type is defined in the following order:

<ol>
<li> For non-void function, the characteristic data type is the return type </li>
<li> If the function has any non-uniform, non-linear parameters, then the
characteristic data type is the type of the first such parameter. </li>
<li> If the characteristic data type determined by either preceding item is
struct, union or class type which is pass-by-value (except for the type that
maps to the built-in complex data type), the characteristic data type is int. </li>
<li> If none of the three cases above applies, the characteristic data type is
int. </li>

</ol>

VLEN is then determined based on the characteristic data type and the POWER8
vector register size. The formula is:

VLEN = maximum_sizeof_POWER8_vector_register(characteristic_data_type) /
sizeof(characteristic_data_type)


</ol>
